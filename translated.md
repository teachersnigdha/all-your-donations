```
Whatever you give, you go out,
All your donations are great,
All your donations,
I said, as I said,
Vogue and torture standards. ... (1)

Give birth to me in the world,
Why did you bring it, Lord?
What duty do I have, do all things,
Unknowingly, Vibhu. ... (2)

Tell me, come on,
There will be no confusion,
The stone face, the mirage match,
It's a mistake to count. ... (3)

Wherever you look, there are many ways,
Tell me which way to go,
Whichever way I go, meet you
There will be a Baikuntha groom. ... (4)

Torture pains, all tolerated,
The rest is up,
O god of the soul, O silent face,
Devkigo cheated me. ... (5)

Whatever you give, you go out,
All your donations are great,
All your donations. ... (6)
